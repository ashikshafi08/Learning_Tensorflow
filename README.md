# Learning_Tensorflow

If you are aware of my previous repo which named Learning_Fastai, I feel good when I update my learning progress straight on the internet rather closing it in my shell. 

## ``` Things I will be doing here ``` 
* Going through the new banger tensorflow course [https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/learn-tensorflow] along with the github repo. Learn and implement projects and get myself into competetions and solve them using Tensorflow. 
* Having plans of going after the Tensorflow Certificate, that would be my goal so that I have a purpose for get going. But the brighter side would be solving problem with another Deep Learning framework. 

Gotta more to add, this repo will look bit tidy in coming days. Stay tuned 🙌🏽
