# Learning_Tensorflow

If you are aware of my previous repo which named Learning_Fastai, I feel good when I update my learning progress straight on the internet rather closing it in my shell. 

## ``` Things I will be doing here ``` 
* Going through the new banger tensorflow course [https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/learn-tensorflow] along with the github repo. Learn and implement projects and get myself into competetions and solve them using Tensorflow. 
* Having plans of going after the Tensorflow Certificate, that would be my goal so that I have a purpose for get going. But the brighter side would be solving problem with another Deep Learning framework. 
* Go through the Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems. [https://www.amazon.in/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291]. 

Gotta more to add, this repo will look bit tidy in coming days. Stay tuned 🙌🏽
